Assign the user compute.osLogin role and iam.serviceAccountUser role, so that the user is able to ssh into the instance and restart the service using command                                                                                                                                                                  
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart                                                                                                    
For the target instance set custom metadata tag to key: enable-oslogin, value: true                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Make changes in the visudo file so that the user can only access the web server for restarting.
